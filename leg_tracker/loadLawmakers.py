#This script will be periodically run to load in lawmakers to the leg_tracker system.
#Probably need to think through the workflow
#When is this run? Automatically or manually?
#Do we keep lawmakers in the database if they're no longer active?
#maybe with the active boolean?
#
#
# usage:
# export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=leg_tracker.settings
# python loadLawmakers.py
